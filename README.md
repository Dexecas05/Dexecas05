## About me:

Hello! My name is Darío Castillo. I'm Argentinian, and I am currently living in Brazil.
I am a trilingual data analyst and a backend programmer.
Along my career I have developed a bunch of soft skills, and the one I value the most is assertive communication, as it enhances the possibility to translate complex and stressful situations into simple solutions and be a nexus between people with different backgrounds.
If you'd like to have consistent solutions and a good understanding, just get to know me.
